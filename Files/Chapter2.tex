\subsection{Introduction}
Fluid flow measurement involves the measurement of the properties of a smooth and uninterrupted stream of flowing particles that conform to a pipe \cite{lanasa2014fluid}. These flow properties include the differential pressure, mass flow rate, fluid velocity and conductivity coefficients, and they are altered and the change measured by flow measuring devices such as the Venturi, the Orifice, turbine flow meters and rotameters. The measurements are finally related to the flow. They are all based on Bernoulli's principle.
