The synthetic hydro-experimental machine used for fluid mechanics experiments in the fluids lab at Jomo Kenyatta University employs an older technology in the measurement of the dynamic pressure component in a fluid. The machine is wholly mechanical as most of the parameters manipulation and measurements are done mechanically. Each step in an experiment to determine the coefficient of discharge of both the Venturi and the orifice involves turning the gate valve by hand, reading the pressure heights from the alcohol manometers, and finally measuring the temperature, time, and the weight of the discharge at the same time. The step size can be inconsistent since it is determined by human intuition. The initiation of time and temperature measurement is to be synchronized with discharge collection. This is of course not usually the case with this machine since it is mechanical and cannot be achieved by a human. These limitations result in a huge error margin in the calculation of the coefficient of discharge.
\par
This project proposal seeks to automate this machine to reduce the error margin while maintaining the credibility of the experiment. This involves using precise steps to turn the gate valves, and digitizing the temperature, time, and weight measurement of the discharge. The temperature, time, and discharge collection will be synchronized by timers controlled by logic in a micro-controller. A user interface will allow for manipulation of parameters such as the number of steps, and time for discharge collection.
\par
This automation will reduce the error margin due to human lag.
