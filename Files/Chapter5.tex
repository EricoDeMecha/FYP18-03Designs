\section{Conclusion}
\par
The objective of this project was to design and fabricate an automated discharge collection process which entailed the design of the discharge flow control unit, the discharge collection unit, the electrical and electronic and the control algorithm which were clearly met. This phase only involved the design work which has been done conclusively.
\par
The next phase to be implemented will involve the fabrication of the developed design. However, it is expected that during this phase, few modifications and redesigns will have to be done to further optimize the design.
