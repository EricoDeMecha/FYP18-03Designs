\section{Expected Outcomes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A discharge collection unit with automated time, temperature and weight measurements fabricated and installed on the main machine. 
    \item An automated discharge flow control unit with a proportional valve incorporated to precisely discharge in steps.
    \item A control algorithm to synergistically integrate the time, weight and temperature measurement with discharge collection.
\end{enumerate}
